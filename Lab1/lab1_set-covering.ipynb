    "Given a number $N$ and some lists of integers $P = (L_0, L_1, L_2, ..., L_n)$, \n",
    "determine is possible $S = (L_{s_0}, L_{s_1}, L_{s_2}, ..., L_{s_n})$\n",

    "* Create the directory `lab1` inside the course repo (the one you registered with Andrea)\n",

    "* In the `README.md`, report the the total numbers of elements in $L_{s_i}$ for problem with $N \\in [5, 10, 20, 100, 500, 1000]$ and the total number on $nodes$ visited during the search. Use `seed=42`.\n",
