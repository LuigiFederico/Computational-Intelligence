# Lab3 - Nim

## Task

Write agents able to play [*Nim*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim), with an arbitrary number of rows and an upper bound $k$ on the number of objects that can be removed in a turn (a.k.a., *subtraction game*).

The goal of the game is to **avoid** taking the last object.

* Task3.1: An agent using fixed rules based on *nim-sum* (i.e., an *expert system*)
* Task3.2: An agent using evolved rules
* Task3.3: An agent using minmax
* Task3.4: An agent using reinforcement learning

## Instructions

* Create the directory `lab3` inside the course repo 
* Put a `README.md` and your solution (all the files, code and auxiliary data if needed)

## Notes

* Working in group is not only allowed, but recommended (see: [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy) and [Cooperative Learning](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1096789.pdf)). Collaborations must be explicitly declared in the `README.md`.
* [Yanking](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KillingAndYanking) from the internet is allowed, but sources must be explicitly declared in the `README.md`.
